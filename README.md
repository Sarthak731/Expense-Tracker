# Expense-Tracker
This project is a web-based expense tracker that allows users to manage and track their income and expenses in a simple and intuitive way. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application helps users keep track of their financial activities by adding and categorizing transactions, calculating balances, and visualizing spending.

Key Features:

Add Transactions: Users can input income or expense transactions by specifying details such as amount, description, and transaction type (income or expense). Each transaction is added to the list and categorized accordingly.

Real-Time Balance Calculation: The application calculates and displays the current balance, total income, and total expenses dynamically as transactions are added or removed.

Transaction History: All transactions are displayed in a list, showing the description, amount, and type (income or expense). Users can easily track their financial activities over time.

Delete Transactions: Users can delete individual transactions from the list, with the balance automatically updating in real-time.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices, with a clean and user-friendly layout.

Technical Stack:

HTML: Provides the structure for the expense tracker, including the input fields for adding transactions, and sections to display the balance, transaction list, and total income/expenses.

CSS: Styles the application with a modern and clean interface, making it easy to navigate and visually appealing. The layout is responsive, ensuring that it looks good on various devices.

JavaScript: Handles the core functionality, including adding transactions, updating the balance in real-time, and managing the transaction history. JavaScript functions are responsible for:

Capturing user input.

Validating inputs to ensure proper data (e.g., numbers for amounts).

Storing transactions in the browserâ€™s local storage so that data persists across sessions.

Dynamically updating the UI to reflect changes in the balance and transaction list.

Project Objectives:

To create an intuitive and functional expense tracking tool that users can easily manage.

To practice handling data storage (using local storage) and real-time UI updates.

To build a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.

To implement JavaScript for dynamic behavior such as form handling, calculations, and data management.

This project serves as a practical introduction to building a dynamic web application, giving users hands-on experience with creating financial management tools while utilizing core web development skills.
